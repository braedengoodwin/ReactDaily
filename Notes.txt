Notes for this project:

What do you want to create?
 - I want to create a website that allows me to 'login'? Idk if I need to set up logins but 
   I want a site that I can go to and get a random react interview question everyday, whether it's a 
   coding problem or more behaviorial. 

Features:
 - site loads a random react question, either code or behavioral 
 - Have a link to the youtube video or site i got the question from
 - have the ability to load another question if you choose
 

 Maybes: 
 - maybe a 'hints' button
 - maybe a 'give' button
